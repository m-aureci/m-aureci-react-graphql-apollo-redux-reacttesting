## Project using React and the GraphCountries API

Consume the Graphql API [GraphCountries](https://github.com/lennertVanSever/graphcountries).

## Scripts

```sh
yarn install     # to install deps
yarn run start   # to run in dev mode
yarn run build   # to build for prod
yarn run test    # to run tests
```


## Layout

I tried to make it as clean as possible.


There are three pages: Home, Detail and Detail Editor:

1. Home:            Home.js    -> [ Search.js -> List.js -> Card.js ] -> 
2. Detail:          Details.js -> [ MapWorld.js -> Pointer.js       ] -> 
3. Detail Editor:   Edit.js    -> Form.js.

* Message.js is used by all pages.
* They are in the components folder.


The "queriesservice" folder is where graphql queries are located for the GraphCountries API.

There are two more folders that are the "tests" and "routes".


## State Management

Fields and the reactive variable of Apollo Client state management.
